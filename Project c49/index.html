                            species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.

                        <li> Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of
                            skills,
                            such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. </li>
                        <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6
                            mph.
                            The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
                        <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
